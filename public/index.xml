      <description>The idea of starting my own blog is one that has been on my mind for a couple of years now. I&amp;#39;m really happy that I finally decided to do something about it. The fate I have in mind for this blog is to contain the treasures I&amp;#39;ll collect during my learning journey.
The first topic on our hands is the creation of this blog.
Technologies used:
hugo nginx docker cloudflare Step by step process Creating the static files with hugo I knew that I didn&amp;#39;t want to make a fancy site with custom css and I didn&amp;#39;t really need to write my blogs in the web browser, so I decided to use a static site generator.</description>
